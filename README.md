  <h4>Performance of Travelling Salesman Problem algorithms</h4>
</div>

**Summary**
The objective of this study was to assess the performance of traveling salesman problem algorithms by measuring execution time and memory usage. The well-known TSPLIB gr17 benchmark was utilized, and the target algorithms included brute force, Held-Karp, quantum phase estimation, and Grover search.
The simulation was constructed using Python's Qiskit and Aer.
